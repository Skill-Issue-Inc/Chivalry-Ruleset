# Chivalry-Ruleset
A ruleset for minecraft servers  
**This document is in progress!!**  
Almost all rules in this document are put in place to protect players. Most rules can be overwritten if the right player grants permission.

## Terminology
Throughout this document moderators, owners, and overseers will be referred to as admins.

# Land Ownership and Property Damage
In general if a piece of land seems modified in any meaningful way, it's probably someone's hard work and may be considered their property. Players are advised to attempt to be aware of others'property boundaries.

### Ownership Powers
A player with ownership powers over a section of the world has absolute say about it second to the server admins. There are several states they can put their land into that will affect how other players may interact with it. In general one may define their own policy, but here some common examples:  
-**No Trespassing** - No player may physically travel onto this land or remotely affect this land in any way without explicit permission.  
-**View only while present** - Players may freely travel onto this land only when the owner is present to supervise. Guests still must not modify in any way (including opening chests) the land without explicit permission.  
-**View only** - Same as the above but the owner need not be present.  
-**Public** - Players may travel through and modify the land without permission. 
Since boundary finding can be a fluid process, if you wish to have a stricter policy it may be wise to create a border that illustrates clearly the edge of the land and have clear markings/signs that convey what guests may do. This may or may not be required at the discretion of the admins.

### Violations
Some of these rules may be bendable depending on the situation and the admins. For instance, if a player wanted to enforce a no trespassing policy on their land but didnâ€™t put up well-defined borders, it may be that the infringing player may not know they have done anything wrong and the admins may determine a simple warning.  
Property damage, or griefing, may be as much as adding or removing a few blocks. Just remember that this is someones safe space that they've worked hard to maintain.  
In general, violations of property damage may incur a sentence requiring the offender to reverse all damages to their original state and a fine. this may change based on the situation.  
Trespassing may incur a fee.

### Spawn
Server spawn area is generally a special kind of territory set aside for all players to pass through.

### Items
In general if something seems modified from its original state it may belong to someone. Items on a player's property have special protections. Items elsewhere that obviously belong to someone *(ie a shulker box sitting somewhere or a diamond sword in a chest near a nether portal)* also are generally under protection.
