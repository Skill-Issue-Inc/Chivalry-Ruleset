**da rules**

mods and owners are admins

if land is modified its probably someones

you can go on the land when the owner is there

you cant when the owner isnt

you can move through and modify public land (i think thats what this means? it needs better writing but this is just the first draft)

trespassing and griefing depending on severity can be a warning or a sentance/fee (?)
punching or using a sword can be an accident, self defense is allowed if you're being attacked with intent to kill

nations are some people who decided to be together and might share stuff, maybe they will do stuff with land? (i have no idea what this one is supposed to mean tbh)

sometimes you can do a little trolling if both sides agree to have a little war (as a treat) but also set some guidelines for that, and make sure everyone consents if you do a true anarchy style with pillaging and destruction

dont hack dats crigne (but small QOL mods are ok, and minimaps that shows players arent allowed)

you gotta have 1 op, and they shouldnt abuse
